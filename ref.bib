  abstract = {The relatively new partial least squares (PLS) regression method is used to relate yearly differences in straw length of 15 barley genotypes to climatic variations over 9 years. After main effects of genotypes and years were removed by conventional two-way ANOVA, the residual table of genotype x year interactions was related to a table of rainfall, temperature, and global radiation at different stages throughout the growth season, over the 9 years. In contrast to ANOVA interaction analysis based on principal component analysis, the related PLS regression method gave a direct, parsimoniuss linear modelling of the systematic relationships between the two tables in one single estimation procedure. Two main factors were found. The first one related warm, dry weather during the ear emergence to higher straw lengths in 6-row barleys than in 2-row barleys. The second factor related climatic differences between the first and last part of the growing season to straw length variations in certain related 2-row barley genotypes.},

  abstract = {Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is one of the most important grain legumes consumed globally, especially in Ethiopia, for its edible seeds, cash crops, and supply of protein for farmers. Efficient statistical methods must be employed for the evaluation of common bean varieties to accurately select superior varieties that contribute to agricultural productivity. The objective of this study was to identify promising large mottled bean varieties through analysis of multi-environment trials (MET) data using multiplicative spatial mixed models. In this study, 16--18 large mottled common bean varieties, including one check, were sown across nine growing environments in Ethiopia using lattice and alpha lattice designs, with three replications laid out in a square or rectangular (row by column) array of plots, respectively during the main cropping season from 2015 to 2018. We present a linear mixed model analysis that integrates spatial and factor analytic (FA) models, and the heritability measure was used to evaluate the efficiency of these models with the conventional analysis. The analysis of the spatial model, and more significantly, the spatial+FA model, revealed a notable enhancement in heritability. With the exception of a trial conducted at Kobo, a genotype DAP 292, found to be good performing for days to flowering and maturity, but for yield only across four clusters of trials, C2, C3, C5 and C7, formed with trials of relatively high genetic variance. Across these clusters, the yield advantage of this variety over the check ranged from 10--32\%. This genotype also has a yield that is somewhat comparable to the check across the remaining clusters. Overall, both the spatial and factor analytic models proved to be effective approaches for analyzing the data in this study. The analysis of multi-environment trial data through the use of more efficient statistical models can provide a more robust platform for evaluating common bean varieties with greater confidence in selecting superior varieties across a range of environments. Hence, scaling up the use of this efficient analysis method is indispensable for enhancing the selection of superior varieties.},

Many use nonlinear operations on co-occurrence statistics, and have hand-tuned hyperparameters and reweighting methods. This paper proposes a new generative model, a dynamic version of the log-linear topic model of{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}citet\{mnih2007three\}. The methodological novelty is to use the prior to compute closed form expressions for word statistics. This provides a theoretical justification for nonlinear models like PMI, word2vec, and GloVe, as well as some hyperparameter choices. It also helps explain why low-dimensional semantic embeddings contain linear algebraic structure that allows solution of word analogies, as shown by{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}citet\{mikolov2013efficient\} and many subsequent papers. Experimental support is provided for the generative model assumptions, the most important of which is that latent word vectors are fairly uniformly dispersed in space.},

  abstract = {Variety advancement decisions for root quality and yield-related traits in cassava are complex due to the variable patterns of genotype-by-environment interactions (GEI). Therefore, studies focused on the dissection of the existing patterns of GEI using linear-bilinear models such as Finlay-Wilkinson (FW), additive main effect and multiplicative interaction (AMMI), and genotype and genotype-by-environment (GGE) interaction models are critical in defining the target population of environments (TPEs) for future testing, selection, and advancement. This study assessed 36 elite cassava clones in 11 locations over three cropping seasons in the cassava breeding program of IITA based in Nigeria to quantify the GEI effects for root quality and yield-related traits. Genetic correlation coefficients and heritability estimates among environments found mostly intermediate to high values indicating high correlations with the major TPE. There was a differential clonal ranking among the environments indicating the existence of GEI as also revealed by the likelihood ratio test (LRT), which further confirmed the statistical model with the heterogeneity of error variances across the environments fit better. For all fitted models, we found the main effects of environment, genotype, and interaction significant for all observed traits except for dry matter content whose GEI sensitivity was marginally significant as found using the FW model. We identified TMS14F1297P0019 and TMEB419 as two topmost stable clones with a sensitivity values of 0.63 and 0.66 respectively using the FW model. However, GGE and AMMI stability value in conjunction with genotype selection index revealed that IITA-TMS-IBA000070 and TMS14F1036P0007 were the top-ranking clones combining both stability and yield performance measures. The AMMI-2 model clustered the testing environments into 6 mega-environments based on winning genotypes for fresh root yield. Alternatively, we identified 3 clusters of testing environments based on genotypic BLUPs derived from the random GEI component.},

The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},

Adoption of the Bayesian paradigm simplifies the interpretation of the results, especially in ranking and selection. Also, complex formulations can be analysed with comparative ease, by using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. A key ingredient in the approach is the need for spatial representations of the unobserved fertility patterns. This is discussed in detail. Problems caused by outliers and by jumps in fertility are tackled via hierarchical t formulations that may find use in other contexts. The paper includes three analyses of variety trials for yield and one example involving binary data; none is entirely straightforward. Some comparisons with frequentist analyses are made.},

Previous attempts have been made to assess the predictive ability of some linear mixed models when GE components are treated as random effects and modeled by the factor analytic (FA) model. This study compares the predictive ability of linear mixed models when the GE is modeled by the FA model with that of simple linear mixed models when the GE is not modeled. A cross-validation scheme is used that randomly deletes some genotypes from sites; the values for these genotypes are then predicted by the different models and correlated with their observed values to assess model accuracy. A total of six multienvironment trials (one potato [Solanum tuberosum L.] trial, three maize [Zea mays L.] trials, and two wheat [Triticum aestivum L.] trials) with GE of varying complexity were used in the evaluation. Results show that for data sets with complex GE, modeling GE using the FA model improved the predictability of the model up to 6\%. When GE is not complex, most models (with and without FA) gave high predictability, and models with FA did not seem to lose much predictive ability. Therefore, we concluded that modeling GE with the FA model is a good thing.},

  abstract = {The use of appropriate statistical methods has a key role in improving the accuracy of selection decisions in a plant breeding program. This is particularly important in the early stages of testing in which selections are based on data from a limited number of field trials that include large numbers of breeding lines with minimal replication. The method of analysis currently recommended for early-stage trials in Australia involves a linear mixed model that includes genetic relatedness via ancestral information: non-genetic effects that reflect the experimental design and a residual model that accommodates spatial dependence. Such analyses have been widely accepted as they have been found to produce accurate predictions of both additive and total genetic effects, the latter providing the basis for selection decisions. In this paper, we present the results of a case study of 34 early-stage trials to demonstrate this type of analysis and to reinforce the importance of including information on genetic relatedness. In addition to the application of a superior method of analysis, it is also critical to ensure the use of sound experimental designs. Recently, model-based designs have become popular in Australian plant breeding programs. Within this paradigm, the design search would ideally be based on a linear mixed model that matches, as closely as possible, the model used for analysis. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the use of models for design generation that include information on genetic relatedness and also include non-genetic and residual models based on the analysis of historic data for individual breeding programs. At present, the most commonly used design generation model omits genetic relatedness information and uses non-genetic and residual models that are supplied as default models in the associated software packages. The major reasons for this are that preexisting software is unacceptably slow for designs incorporating genetic relatedness and the accuracy gains resulting from the use of genetic relatedness have not been quantified. Both of these issues are addressed in the current paper. An updating scheme for calculating the optimality criterion in the design search is presented and is shown to afford prodigious computational savings. An in silico study that compares three types of design function across a range of ancillary treatments shows the gains in accuracy for the prediction of total genetic effects (and thence selection) achieved from model-based designs using genetic relatedness and program specific non-genetic and residual models.},

In contrast the static component accounts for only 5.3\% of the total. We develop methods for determining the relative accuracy of CVEP based on selection of newly promoted entries. The accuracy of the current testing regimes for the Australian CVEP under study is determined. The accuracy of alternative schemes, with different numbers of years of testing, numbers of locations per year and numbers of replicates per trial is also examined. Cost effective methods for improving the accuracy of CVEP are discussed.},

  abstract = {Modelling additive genotype-by-environment interaction is best achieved with the use of factor analytic models. With numerous environments and for outcrossing plant species, computation is facilitated using reduced animal models. The development of efficient plant breeding strategies requires a knowledge of the magnitude and structure of genotype-by-environment interaction. This information can be obtained from appropriate linear mixed model analyses of phenotypic data from multi-environment trials. The use of factor analytic models for genotype-by-environment effects is known to provide a reliable, parsimonious and holistic approach for obtaining estimates of genetic correlations between all pairs of trials. When breeding for outcrossing species the focus is on estimating additive genetic correlations and effects which is achieved by including pedigree information in the analysis. The use of factor analytic models in this setting may be computationally prohibitive when the number of environments is moderate to large. In this paper, we present an approach that uses an approximate reduced animal model to overcome the computational issues associated with factor analytic models for additive genotype-by-environment effects. The approach is illustrated using a Pinus radiata breeding dataset involving 77 trials, located in environments across New Zealand and south eastern Australia, and with pedigree information on 315,581 trees. Using this approach we demonstrate the existence of substantial additive genotype-by-environment interaction for the trait of stem diameter measured at breast height. This finding has potentially significant implications for both breeding and deployment strategies. Although our approach has been developed for forest tree breeding programmes, it is directly applicable for other outcrossing plant species, including sugarcane, maize and numerous horticultural crops.},

  abstract = {The genomic prediction of phenotypes and breeding values in animals and plants has developed rapidly into its own research field. Results of genomic prediction studies are often difficult to compare because data simulation varies, real or simulated data are not fully described, and not all relevant results are reported. In addition, some new methods have been compared only in limited genetic architectures, leading to potentially misleading conclusions. In this article we review simulation procedures, discuss validation and reporting of results, and apply benchmark procedures for a variety of genomic prediction methods in simulated and real example data. Plant and animal breeding programs are being transformed by the use of genomic data, which are becoming widely available and cost-effective to predict genetic merit. A large number of genomic prediction studies have been published using both simulated and real data. The relative novelty of this area of research has made the development of scientific conventions difficult with regard to description of the real data, simulation of genomes, validation and reporting of results, and forward in time methods. In this review article we discuss the generation of simulated genotype and phenotype data, using approaches such as the coalescent and forward in time simulation. We outline ways to validate simulated data and genomic prediction results, including cross-validation. The accuracy and bias of genomic prediction are highlighted as performance indicators that should be reported. We suggest that a measure of relatedness between the reference and validation individuals be reported, as its impact on the accuracy of genomic prediction is substantial. A large number of methods were compared in example simulated and real (pine and wheat) data sets, all of which are publicly available. In our limited simulations, most methods performed similarly in traits with a large number of quantitative trait loci (QTL), whereas in traits with fewer QTL variable selection did have some advantages. In the real data sets examined here all methods had very similar accuracies. We conclude that no single method can serve as a benchmark for genomic prediction. We recommend comparing accuracy and bias of new methods to results from genomic best linear prediction and a variable selection approach (e.g., BayesB), because, together, these methods are appropriate for a range of genetic architectures. An accompanying article in this issue provides a comprehensive review of genomic prediction methods and discusses a selection of topics related to application of genomic prediction in plants and animals.},

We tested this idea as a proof-of-concept by comparing a durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) decentralized trial distributed as incomplete blocks in 1,165 farmer-managed fields across the Ethiopian highlands with a benchmark representing genomic prediction applied to conventional breeding. We found that 3D-breeding could double the prediction accuracy of the benchmark. 3D-breeding could identify genotypes with enhanced local adaptation providing superior productive performance across seasons.

In this study, we used a large, but unbalanced, dataset from a barley breeding program to estimate the effects of the Ha2, Ha4, and sdw1 genes on grain yield, grain weight, grain protein, malt extract, and diastatic power. The Ha2 and Ha4 genes for resistance to cereal cyst nematode were under intense selection pressure, whereas the sdw1 gene, which reduces plant height, was under mild selection pressure. From a mixed-model analysis of mainly F5-derived lines over 5 years, resistance due to the Ha2 gene was found to increase grain yields at 2 sites where the nematode was expected to be present, but not at 3 other sites. There was no significant effect of Ha4 on grain yield. Because of selection, data from later stages of evaluation were not useable for Ha2 or Ha4. From analyses of both early stage and later stages of evaluation, the semi-dwarf allele of the sdw1 gene increased grain yields at high-yielding sites, but decreased yields at low-yielding sites. The semi-dwarf allele reduced grain weight. The effects of Ha2 or Ha4 on malt extract and diastatic power were not significant, but the semi-dwarf allele at sdw1 reduced grain protein. We concluded that plant breeding data can be used to successfully estimate the effects of important genes, with bias due to selection minimised by the use of data from appropriate stages of selection and the use of appropriate statistical models.},

In order to select the best genotypes, during the final selection stage, varieties are tested in different environments (locations and years), and breeders need to estimate the phenotypic performance for main traits such as tons of cane yield per hectare (TCH) considering the genotype {\texttimes} environment interaction (GEI) effect. Geneticists and biometricians have used different methods and there is no clear consensus of the best method. In this study, we present a comparison of three methods, viz. Eberhart-Russel (ER), additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) and mixed model (REML/BLUP), in a simulation study performed in the R computing environment to verify the effectiveness of each method in detecting GEI, and assess the particularities of each method from a statistical standpoint. In total, 63 cases representing different conditions were simulated, generating more than 34 million data points for analysis by each of the three methods. The results show that each method detects GEI differently in a different way, and each has some limitations. All three methods detected GEI effectively, but the mixed model showed higher sensitivity. When applying the GEI analysis, firstly it is important to verify the assumptions inherent in each method and these limitations should be taken into account when choosing the method to be used.},

  abstract = {The adaptation of barley varieties was studied by the use of grain yields of a randomly chosen group of 277 varieties from a world collection, grown in replicated trials for several seasons at three sites in South Australia. For each variety a linear regression of yield on the mean yield of all varieties for each site and season was computed to measure variety adaptation. In these calculations the basic yields were measured on a logarithmic scale, as it was found that a high degree of linearity was thereby induced. The mean yield of all varieties for each site and season provided a quantitative grading of the environments; and from the analysis described, varieties specifically adapted to good or poor seasons and those showing general adaptability may be identified. The study of the adaptation of the whole population of varieties was facilitated by the use of a two-dimensional plot (scatter diagram), with mean yield and regression coefficient as coordinates for each variety. Though wide variation was evident in both mean yield and sensitivity to environment as characterized by the regression coefficient, the variation in sensitivity was proportionately less among varieties with higher mean yield, and the varieties with highest mean yield exhibited, within very narrow limits (regression coefficients close to 0.8), a similar degree of adaptation to all environments over the wide range, especially of seasonal conditions, typical of the South Australian cereal belt. Varieties from particular geographic regions of the world showed a similarity in type of adaptation, which provides a useful basis for plant introduction. Phenotypic stability and physiological and morphological characteristics of groups of varieties with specific or general adaptability are discussed in relation to plant introduction and breeding.},

The components are nonstationary, large-scale (global) variation across the field, stationary variation within the trial (natural variation or local trend), and extraneous variation that is often induced by experimental procedures and is predominantly aligned with rows and columns. We present a strategy for identifying a model for the plot errors that uses a trellis plot of residuals, a perspective plot of the sample variogram and, where possible, likelihood ratio tests to identify which components are present. We demonstrate the strategy using two illustrative examples. We conclude that although there is no one model that adequately fits all field experiments, the separable au-toregressive model is dominant. However, there is often additional identifiable variation present.},

  abstract = {A one-stage analysis of a series of variety trials involves a combined analysis of the individual plot data across trials. Together with prudent modelling of the genetic effects across trials, this is considered to be the gold standard analysis of multi-environment field trial data. An alternative is a two-stage approach in which the variety means from an analysis of the individual trials in stage one are combined into a weighted mixed model analysis in stage two to give the full set of predicted variety by environment effects and an estimate of their associated variance structure. The two-stage analysis will exactly reproduce the one-stage analysis if the full variance-covariance matrix of the means from stage one is known and is utilised in stage two. Typically the full matrix is not stored and a diagonal approximation is used. This introduces a compromise to the full analysis. The impacts of a diagonal approximation are greater in the presence of sophisticated models for the genetic effects. A second compromise is through a loss of information in estimating the non-genetic variance parameters using the two-stage approach. In this paper we draw a direct link between the one and two-stage analysis approaches for crop variety evaluation data in Australia. We now have the computing power to analyse large and complex multi-environment variety trial data sets using the one-stage approach without the need for a two-stage approximation. This should motivate a move away from the two-stage approach in a range of contexts.},

Such models are parameterised distributions over rankings of a finite set of objects, and have typically been studied and applied within the psychometric, sociometric and econometric literature. The inference scheme is an application of Power EP (expectation propagation). The scheme is robust and can be readily applied to large scale data sets. The inference algorithm extends to variations of the basic Plackett-Luce model, including partial rankings. We show a number of advantages of the EP approach over the traditional maximum likelihood method. We apply the method to aggregate rankings of NASCAR racing drivers over the 2002 season, and also to rankings of movie genres.},

The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

  abstract = {The statistical modelling of ranking data has a long history and encompasses various perspectives on how observed rankings arise. One of the most common models, the Plackett-Luce model, is frequently used to aggregate rankings from multiple rankers into a single ranking that corresponds to the underlying quality of the ranked objects. Given that rankers frequently exhibit heterogeneous preferences, mixture-type models have been developed to group rankers with more or less homogeneous preferences together to reduce bias. However, occasionally, these preference groups are known a-priori. Under these circumstances, current practice consists of fitting Plackett-Luce models separately for each group. Nevertheless, there might be some commonalities between different groups of rankers, such that separate estimation implies a loss of information. We propose an extension of the Plackett-Luce model, the Sparse Fused Plackett-Luce model, that allows for joint learning of such heterogeneous rank data, whereby information from different groups is utilised to achieve better model performance. The observed rankings can be considered a function of variables pertaining to the ranked objects. As such, we allow for these types of variables, where information on the coefficients is shared across groups. Moreover, as not all variables might be relevant for the ranking of an object, we impose sparsity on the coefficients to improve interpretability, estimation and prediction of the model. Simulations studies indicate superior performance of the proposed method compared to existing approaches. To illustrate the usage and interpretation of the method, an application on data consisting of consumer preferences regarding various sweet potato varieties is provided. An R package containing the proposed methodology can be found on https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SFPL.},

Our objective was to find the ``best'' method for estimating mean yields for the cultivars and experimental ines included in a series of trials that did not contain all entries in equal numbers. The methods of estimation included percent of checks, summation of differences between entries and checks, an unweighted two-way analysis with trials and entries as factors, a weighted two-way analysis, and three versions of best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP). The versions of BLUP involved different estimates of the entry and environmental variance components. The trial series included 150 different entries (cultivars ande xperimentasl ynthetics) that had been evaluated in one to 14 trials between 1975 and 1982. Eleven of these trials had data for total yield for each of three growing seasons. Each of the methods of estimation were conducted with each of the 11 complete trials omitted from the data set, and estimates were used to predict means for the omitted trial. The method with smallest prediction error was judged ``best.'' The smallest prediction errors were obtained with the version of BLUP in which the entry and environmental variances were estimated from an unbalanced two-way (trials and entries) analysis of variance. The second best method was the version of BLUP in which environmental and entry variances were estimated from the pooled sums of squares over trials. The version of BLUP in which variances were estimated for each trial ranked third and was only slightly superior to the summation of differences, unweighted, and the weighted analyses. The percent of checks had the largest prediction errors of all the methods we evaluated.},

Non-identical rank orders are the result of genotype x environment interactions. Not every interaction, however, causes rank changes among the genotypes (rank-interaction). From a breeder's point of view, interaction is tolerable only as long as it does not affect the rank orders. Therefore, the question arises of under which circumstances does interaction become rank-interaction. This paper contributes to our understanding of this topic. In our study we emphasized the detection of relationships between the similarity of the rank orders (measured by Kendall's coefficient of concordance W) and the functions of the diverse variance components (genotypes, environments, interaction, error). On the basis of extensive data sets on different agricultural crops (faba bean, fodder beet, sugar beet, oats, winter rape) obtained from registration trials (1985--1989) carried out in the Federal Republic of Germany, we obtained the following as main result: W {$\cong$} {$\sigma$}2g/({$\sigma$}2g+ {$\sigma$}2v) where {$\sigma$}2g=genotypic variance and {$\sigma$}2v= {$\sigma$}2ge+ {$\sigma$}2o/L with {$\sigma$}2ge=interaction variance, {$\sigma$}2o=error variance and L=number of replications.},

  abstract = {Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) faces challenges in coordinating agents due to complex interdependencies within multi-agent systems. Most MARL algorithms use the simultaneous decision-making paradigm but ignore the action-level dependencies among agents, which reduces coordination efficiency. In contrast, the sequential decision-making paradigm provides finer-grained supervision for agent decision order, presenting the potential for handling dependencies via better decision order management. However, determining the optimal decision order remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce Action Generation with Plackett-Luce Sampling (AGPS), a novel mechanism for agent decision order optimization. We model the order determination task as a Plackett-Luce sampling process to address issues such as ranking instability and vanishing gradient during the network training process. AGPS realizes credit-based decision order determination by establishing a bridge between the significance of agents' local observations and their decision credits, thus facilitating order optimization and dependency management. Integrating AGPS with the Multi-Agent Transformer, we propose the Prioritized Multi-Agent Transformer (PMAT), a sequential decision-making MARL algorithm with decision order optimization. Experiments on benchmarks including StarCraft II Multi-Agent Challenge, Google Research Football, and Multi-Agent MuJoCo show that PMAT outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, greatly enhancing coordination efficiency.},

  abstract = {Triadic comparison of technologies (tricot) is a recently developed on-farm evaluation method involving farmers conducting small, simple trials on their farms. Farmers are provided with a selection of three varieties from a larger set and report the best and worst varieties for traits, such as yield, resistance and overall performance. The strength of the tricot approach is that it involves a large number of farmers in diverse conditions so that researchers can obtain diverse data on the actual differences in disease resistance. On the other hand, the tricot approach has some limitations: information is lost due to ranking-based evaluation, and farmers may find it hard to evaluate hard-to-score traits like pest and disease resistance reliably. In particular, the potential of evaluating resistance using rankings is unknown, and this study focused on farmers' pest and disease resistance evaluation in the tricot trial. Results indicated that farmers' evaluation in the tricot trial could find varietal differences in potatoes' bacterial wilt resistance rankings in Rwanda, which suggests farmers' evaluation for this was not random. Bacterial wilt resistance was a significant predictor of overall performance independently of confounding variables, yield and vigour. This indicated that farmers evaluated disease resistance independently of potential confounders. The preferred variety of bacterial wilt resistance varied depending on whether the maximum day temperature during the vegetative period was above or below 25.43{$^\circ$}C. This result aligned with the known disease-occurring factor that bacterial wilt causes the most severe damage when the temperature ranges between 25{$^\circ$}C and 35{$^\circ$}C. Additionally, the susceptible variety was selected as the least preferred in warmer environments, where the disease is known to cause severe damage. These results suggest that farmers' evaluations of bacterial wilt resistance reflect the actual differences in disease resistance. On the contrary, pest and disease resistance evaluations in other crops did not show significant differences between varieties. There could be several reasons for this, including the use of pesticides, unsuitable timing of evaluations, and not focusing on a specific pest. Assessing pest resistance by farmers has been thought to be challenging due to the requirement of specialised knowledge. However, this study suggested the possibility of obtaining the actual differences in disease resistance from farmers' best and worst evaluations under the right conditions, potentially accelerating the selection of pestresistant varieties suitable for specific on-farm environments.},

The factor analytic (FA) model is a parsimonious form used to approximate the fully unstructured form of the genetic variance--covariance matrix in the model for MET data. In this study, we demonstrate that the FA model is generally the model of best fit across a range of data sets taken from early generation trials in a breeding program. In addition, we demonstrate the superiority of the FA model in achieving the most common aim of METs, namely the selection of superior genotypes. Selection is achieved using best linear unbiased predictions (BLUPs) of cultivar effects at each environment, considered either individually or as a weighted average across environments. In practice, empirical BLUPs (E-BLUPs) of cultivar effects must be used instead of BLUPs since variance parameters in the model must be estimated rather than assumed known. While the optimal properties of minimum mean squared error of prediction (MSEP) and maximum correlation between true and predicted effects possessed by BLUPs do not hold for E-BLUPs, a simulation study shows that E-BLUPs perform well in terms of MSEP.},

In addition to enhancing our theoretical understanding of these methods, our derivation leads to a principled framework that can be used to construct new self-supervised tasks. We provide an example by drawing inspirations from related methods based on mutual information maximization that have been successful in computer vision, and introduce a simple self-supervised objective that maximizes the mutual information between a global sentence representation and n-grams in the sentence. Our analysis offers a holistic view of representation learning methods to transfer knowledge and translate progress across multiple domains (e.g., natural language processing, computer vision, audio processing).},

  abstract = {Genotype by environment interaction (GEI) is an important phenomenon in plant breeding. This paper presents a series of models for describing, exploring, understanding and predicting GEI. All models depart from a two-way table of genotype by environment means. First, a series of descriptive and explorative models/ approaches are presented: Finlay-Wilkinson model, AMMI model, GGE biplot. All of these approaches have in common that they merely try to group genotypes and environments and do not use other information than the two-way table of means. Next, factorial regression is introduced as an approach to explicitly introduce genotypic and environmental covariates for describing and explaining GEI. Finally, QTL modeling is presented as a natural extension of factorial regression, where marker information is translated into genetic predictors. Tests for regression coefficients corresponding to these genetic predictors are tests for main effect QTL expression and QTL by environment interaction (QEI). QTL models for which QEI depends on environmental covariables form an interesting model class for predicting GEI for new genotypes and new environments. For realistic modeling of genotypic differences across multiple environments, sophisticated mixed models are necessary to allow for heterogeneity of genetic variances and correlations across environments. The use and interpretation of all models is illustrated by an example data set from the CIMMYT maize breeding program, containing environments differing in drought and nitrogen stress. To help readers to carry out the statistical analyses, GenStat\&\#174; programs, 15th Edition and Discovery\&\#174; version, are presented as supplementary material.},

Several nonparametric methods proposed by Huhn (1979, EDP in Medicine and Biology 10, 112-117) are based on the ranks of genotypes in each environment and use the idea of homeostasis as a measure of stability. In this study the statistical properties and tests of significance for two of these nonparametric measures of phenotypic stability (mean of the absolute rank differences of a genotype over the environments and variance among the ranks over the environments) are investigated. The purpose of this study is to develop approximate but easily applied statistical tests based on the normal distribution. Finally, application of the theoretical results is demonstrated using data on 20 genotypes (varieties) of winter wheat in 10 environments (locations) from the official German registration trials.},

  abstract = {Mixture models of Plackett-Luce (PL), one of the most fundamental ranking models, are an active research area of both theoretical and practical significance. Most previously proposed parameter estimation algorithms instantiate the EM algorithm, often with random initialization. However, such an initialization scheme may not yield a good initial estimate and the algorithms require multiple restarts, incurring a large time complexity. As for the EM procedure, while the E-step can be performed efficiently, maximizing the log-likelihood in the M-step is difficult due to the combinatorial nature of the PL likelihood function. Therefore, previous authors favor algorithms that maximize surrogate likelihood functions. However, the final estimate may deviate from the true maximum likelihood estimate as a consequence. In this paper, we address these known limitations. We propose an initialization algorithm that can provide a provably accurate initial estimate and an EM algorithm that maximizes the true log-likelihood function efficiently. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets show that our algorithm is competitive in terms of accuracy and speed to baseline algorithms, especially on datasets with a large number of items.},

  abstract = {Modeling the genotype {\texttimes} environment interaction (GEI) and quantifying genotypic stability are crucial steps for selecting/recommending genotypes in multi-environment trials (METs). The efficiency in selection/recommendation could be greater if based on multiple traits, but identifying genotypes that combine high performance and stability across many traits has been a difficult task. In this study, we propose a multi-trait stability index (MTSI) for simultaneous selection considering mean performance and stability (MPE) in the analysis of METs using both fixed and mixed-effect models. Data from an MET where 14 traits were assessed in 22 genotypes of Avena sativa L. were used to illustrate the application of the method. The genotypic stability was quantified for each trait using the weighted average of absolute scores from the singular value decomposition of the matrix of best linear unbiased predictions for the GEI effects generated by an linear mixed-effect model (WAASB) index (lower is better). A superiority index, WAASBY (higher is better) was calculated to consider the MPE. The selection differential for the WAASBY index ranged from 9.7 to 44.6\%. Positive selection differential (1.75\% {$\leq$} selection differential {$\leq$} 17.8\%) were observed for trait means that wanted to increase and negative (--11.7\%) for one variable that wanted to reduce. The negative selection differential observed for WAASB (--63\% {$\leq$} selection differential {$\leq$} -12\%) suggested that the selected genotypes were more stable. The MTSI should be useful for breeders and agronomists who desire a selection for MPE based on multiple traits because it provides a robust and easy-to-handle selection process, accounting for the correlation structure of the traits. The application of the MTSI in future studies is facilitated by a step-by-step guide and an R package containing useful functions. Core Ideas The genotypic stability was quantified in multi-environment trials (MET) using mixed models. A superiority index that allows weighting between mean performance and stability was used. A multi-trait stability index (MTSI) for identifying superior genotypes in MET was proposed. Using a real dataset from a MET, stable and high-performance genotypes were identified. The MTSI should facilitate the genotype selection in a multi-trait framework.},

As new methods are proposed, analysing MET data correctly and completely remains a challenge, often intractable with existing tools. Here we describe the metan R package, a collection of functions that implement a workflow-based approach to (a) check, manipulate and summarize typical MET data; (b) analyse individual environments using both fixed and mixed-effect models; (c) compute parametric and nonparametric stability statistics; (d) implement biometrical models widely used in MET analysis and (e) plot typical MET data quickly. In this paper, we present a summary of the functions implemented in metan and how they integrate into a workflow to explore and analyse MET data. We guide the user along a gentle learning curve and show how adding only a few commands or options at a time, powerful analyses can be implemented. metan offers a flexible, intuitive and richly documented working environment with tools that will facilitate the implementation of a complete analysis of MET datasets.},

This method was originally developed in animal breeding for estimation of breeding values and is now widely used in many areas of research. It does not, however, seem to have gained the same popularity in plant breeding and variety testing as it has in animal breeding. In plants, application of mixed models with random genetic effects has up until recently been mainly restricted to the estimation of genetic and non-genetic components of variance, whereas estimation of genotypic values is mostly based on a model with fixed effects. This paper reviews recent developments in the application of BLUP in plant breeding and variety testing. These include the use of pedigree information to model and exploit genetic correlation among relatives and the use of flexible variance--covariance structures for genotype-by-environment interaction. We demonstrate that BLUP has good predictive accuracy compared to other procedures. While pedigree information is often included via the so-called numerator relationship matrix \$\$(\{{\textbackslash}user2\{A\}\})\$\$, we stress that it is frequently straightforward to exploit the same information by a simple mixed model without explicit reference to the \$\$\{{\textbackslash}user2\{A\}\}\$\$-matrix.},

This paper proposes a method to obtain BLUPs based on models with multiplicative terms.

It involves a regression on the environmental mean, indexing the productivity of an environment, which is driven by a wide array of environmental factors. Increasingly, it is becoming feasible to characterize environments explicitly using observable environmental covariates. Hence, there is mounting interest to replace the environmental index with an explicit regression on such observable environmental covariates. This paper reviews the development of such methods. The focus is on parsimonious models that allow replacing the environmental index by regression on synthetic environmental covariates formed as linear combinations of a larger number of observable environmental covariates. Two new methods are proposed for obtaining such synthetic covariates, which may be integrated into genotype-specific regression models, that is, criss-cross regression and a factor-analytic approach. The main advantage of such explicit modelling is that predictions can be made also for new environments where trials have not been conducted. A published dataset is employed to illustrate the proposed methods.},

  abstract = {Plant breeders and variety testing agencies routinely test candidate genotypes (crop varieties, lines, test hybrids) in multiple environments. Such multi-environment trials can be efficiently analysed by mixed models. A single-stage analysis models the entire observed data at the level of individual plots. This kind of analysis is usually considered as the gold standard. In practice, however, it is more convenient to use a two-stage approach, in which experiments are first analysed per environment, yielding adjusted means per genotype, which are then summarised across environments in the second stage. Stage-wise approaches suggested so far are approximate in that they cannot fully reproduce a single-stage analysis, except in very simple cases, because the variance--covariance matrix of adjusted means from individual environments needs to be approximated by a diagonal matrix. This paper proposes a fully efficient stage-wise method, which carries forward the full variance--covariance matrix of adjusted means from the individual environments to the analysis across the series of trials. Provided the variance components are known, this method can fully reproduce the results of a single-stage analysis. Computations are made efficient by a diagonalisation of the residual variance--covariance matrix, which necessitates a corresponding linear transformation of both the first-stage estimates (e.g. adjusted means and regression slopes for plot covariates) and the corresponding design matrices for fixed and random effects. We also exemplify the extension of the general approach to a three-stage analysis. The method is illustrated using two datasets, one real and the other simulated. The proposed approach has close connections with meta-analysis, where environments correspond to centres and genotypes to medical treatments. We therefore compare our theoretical results with recently published results from a meta-analysis.},

  abstract = {Learn how to best improve yield in cereal plants - even in dry conditions.The impact of drought on crop production can be economically devastating. Drought Adaptation in Cereals provides a comprehensive review of the latest research on the tolerance of cereal crops to water-limited conditions. Renowned experts extensively describe basic concepts and cutting-edge research results to clearly reveal all facets of drought adaptation in cereals. More than simply a fine reference for plant biology and plant improvement under water-limited conditions, this book spotlights the most relevant biological approaches from plant phenotyping to functional genomics.The need to understand plant response to the lack of water is integral to forming strategies to best manage crops. Drought Adaptation in Cereals starts by offering an overview of the biological basis and defines the adaptive mechanisms found in plants under water-limited conditions. Different approaches are presented to provide understanding of plant genetics basics and plant breeding, including phenotyping, physiology, and biotechnology. The book details drought adaptation mechanisms at the cellular, organ, and entire plant levels, focusing on plant metabolism and gene functions. This resource is extensively referenced and contains tables, charts, and figures to clearly present data and enhance understanding.After a foreword by J. O'Toole and a prologue by A. Blum, Drought Adaptation in Cereals presents a full spectrum of informative topics from other internationally respected scientists. These include: drought's economic impact (P. Heisey) genotype-by-environment interactions (M. Cooper) secondary traits for drought adaptation (P. Monneveux) leaf growth (F. Tardieu) carbon isotope discrimination (T. Condon) drought adaptation in barley (M. Sorrells), maize (M. Sawkins), rice (R. Lafitte), sorghum (A. Borrell) and wheat (M. Reynolds) carbohydrate metabolism (A. Tiessen) the role of abscisic acid (T. Setter) protection mechanisms and stress proteins (L. Mtwisha) genetic basis of ion homeostasis and water deficit (H. Bohnert) transcriptional factors (K. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki) resurrection plants (D. Bartels) Drought Adaptation in Cereals is a unique, vital reference for scientists, educators, and students in plant biology, agronomy, and natural resources management.},

It can be used to derive the Kalman filter, the method of Kriging used for ore reserve estimation, credibility theory used to work out insurance premiums, and Hoadley's quality measurement plan used to estimate a quality index. It can be used for removing noise from images and for small-area estimation. This paper presents the theory of BLUP, some examples of its application and its relevance to the foundations of statistics.

There are numerous reasons for their use, including the ease with which incomplete data (not all varieties in all trials) can be handled and the ability to appropriately model within-trial error variation. Currently, the most common mixed model approaches for series of variety trials are mixed model versions of the methods summarized by Kempton (1984).

The multiplicative model corresponds to that used in the multivariate technique of factor analysis. It allows a separate genetic variance for each environment and provides a parsimonious and interpretable model for the genetic covariances between environments. The model can be regarded as a random effects analogue of AMMI (additive main effects and multiplicative interactions).

  abstract = {This thesis is concerned with the analysis of data from series of plant variety trials,  also known as Multi-Environment Trials (MET). These involve the evaluation of varieties in designed experiments at a number of locations and possibly over several years.  There is usually interest in obtaining an overall measure of performance for each variety (across environments) and in quantifying and interpreting variety by environment  (V{\texttimes}E) interactions.  MET data routinely exhibit heterogeneity of variance and covariance at several levels.  Error variance often differs between trials and spatial variation within trials is common.  In addition genetic variance differs between trials and there is heterogeneity of genetic  covariance between pairs of trials. This thesis presents a mixed model approach to the  analysis of MET data which accommodates all of these sources of heterogeneity.  Chapter 1 presents an overview of the issues associated with the analysis of MET data  and includes a review of existing approaches. The new approach developed in this  thesis is introduced.  Chapter 2 presents important results concerning the estimation of linear mixed models.  Topics covered include estimation of fixed and random effects, estimation of variance  parameters using Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML) and the Average Information  algorithm, inference and computing strategies.  Chapter 3 presents the spatial mixed model approach to the analysis of individual field  trials (Gilmour et al. , 1997). This is illustrated with examples in Chapter 4.  In Chapter 5 the new mixed model approach to the analysis of MET data is presented.  The model accommodates error variance heterogeneity between trials and spatial vari vi  ation within trials (as per Cullis et al. , 1998) and models the variety effects in each  environment (that is, the sum of variety main effects and V{\texttimes}E interactions) using the  Factor Analytic model (Mardia et al. , 1988). This consists of a multiplicative model  of variety ``scores'' and environment ``loadings''. It allows a separate genetic variance  for each trial and a parsimonious and interpretable model for the genetic correlations  between trials. Issues discussed include non-uniqueness of loadings (constraints for estimation and subsequent rotation for interpretation), model estimation, formal tests of  goodness-of-fit (number of multiplicative terms) and interpretation (bi-plots, obtaining  estimates of overall variety performance). The technique is illustrated with an example  in Chapter 6.  Chapter 7 discusses the explicit inclusion of variety main effects with the Factor Analytic model then applied to the V{\texttimes}E interactions. Issues covered include transformation of the loadings to avoid mis-interpretation of variety main effects and the consequent need for correlations between variety main effects and variety scores from the  multiplicative part of model. The chapter concludes with an example.  Chapter 8 presents results of a simulation study to examine the convergence behaviour  of Factor Analytic models. Algorithms investigated are the Average Information algorithm for estimation of all variance parameters and the Expectation-Maximisation  (EM) algorithm for estimation of factor loadings. The results suggest the need for  fitting multiplicative models with reduced rank variance structures. An estimation  method for such models is given in the final section of the chapter.  Chapter 9 presents concluding remarks including reference to the applicability of the  methodology to problems other than the analysis of MET data.},

This model can accommodate unbalanced data, that is, not all varieties in all environments, it allows the use of pedigree information and appropriate accommodation of individual trial experimental designs, and most importantly the FA structure for the variety by environment effects is parsimonious and regularly results in a good fit to the data. The model provides accurate predictions of the variety effects for every environment in the data-set but this constitutes a large and unwieldly amount of information to process for the purpose of variety selection. We address this issue in the current paper by proposing factor analytic selection tools to summarise the predictions in a concise yet informative manner. The tools, which are natural derivatives of the FA structure, result in measures of overall performance and stability across the environments in the data-set. All measures are expressed on the same scale as the trait under consideration and can easily be combined to form an index for selection.},

This is addressed in the current paper by fitting a factor analytic linear mixed model (FALMM) then using the fundamental factor analytic parameters to define groups of environments in the dataset within which there is minimal crossover VEI, but between which there may be substantial crossover VEI. These groups are consequently called interaction classes (iClasses). Given that the environments within an iClass exhibit minimal crossover VEI, it is then valid to obtain predictions of overall variety performance (across environments) for each iClass. These predictions can then be used not only to select the best varieties within each iClass but also to match varieties in terms of their patterns of VEI across iClasses. The latter is aided with the use of a new graphical tool called an iClass Interaction Plot. The ideas are introduced in this paper within the framework of FALMMs in which the genetic effects for different varieties are assumed independent. The application to FALMMs which include information on genetic relatedness is the subject of a subsequent paper.},

  abstract = {The concept of interaction classes (iClasses) for multi-environment trial data was introduced to address the problem of summarising variety performance across environments in the presence of variety by environment interaction (VEI). The approach involves the fitting of a factor analytic linear mixed model (FALMM), with the resultant estimates of factor loadings being used to form groups of environments (iClasses) that discriminate varieties with different patterns of VEI. It is then meaningful to summarise variety performance across environments within iClasses. The iClass methodology was developed with respect to a FALMM in which the genetic effects for different varieties were assumed independent. This was done for pedagogical reasons but it was pointed out that the accuracy of variety selection is greatly enhanced by considering the genetic relatedness of varieties, either via ancestral or genomic information. The focus of the current paper is therefore to extend the iClass approach for FALMMs which incorporate such information. In addition, a measure of stability of variety performance across iClasses is defined. The utility of the approach for variety selection is illustrated using a multi-environment trial dataset from the lentil breeding programme operated by Agriculture Victoria.},

Mixed models, also commonly known as multi-level, nested, hierarchical or panel data models, incorporate a combination of fixed and random effects, with LMMs being a special case. The inclusion of random effects in particular gives LMMs considerable flexibility in accounting for many types of complex correlated structures often found in data. This flexibility, however, has given rise to a number of ways by which an end-user can specify the precise form of the LMM that they wish to fit in statistical software. In this paper, we review the software design for specification of the LMM (and its special case, the linear model), focusing in particular on the use of high-level symbolic model formulae and two popular but contrasting R-packages in lme4 and asreml.},

The main algorithmic challenge in this work is that even fast methods for solving D-optimal designs would have \$O(\{N {\textbackslash}choose K\})\$ time complexity. To address this issue, we propose a randomized Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm that solves the linear maximization sub-problems in the FW method on randomly chosen variables. We analyze the algorithm, and evaluate it empirically on synthetic and open-source NLP datasets.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the R package PlackettLuce, which implements a generalization of the Plackett--Luce model for rankings data. The generalization accommodates both ties (of arbitrary order) and partial rankings (complete rankings of subsets of items). By default, the implementation adds a set of pseudo-comparisons with a hypothetical item, ensuring that the underlying network of wins and losses between items is always strongly connected. In this way, the worth of each item always has a finite maximum likelihood estimate, with finite standard error. The use of pseudo-comparisons also has a regularization effect, shrinking the estimated parameters towards equal item worth. In addition to standard methods for model summary, PlackettLuce provides a method to compute quasi standard errors for the item parameters. This provides the basis for comparison intervals that do not change with the choice of identifiability constraint placed on the item parameters. Finally, the package provides a method for model-based partitioning using covariates whose values vary between rankings, enabling the identification of subgroups of judges or settings with different item worths. The features of the package are demonstrated through application to classic and novel data sets.},

These models offer parsimonious descriptions and facilitate interpretations in biological terms. A disadvantage of the prevailing dominance of two-way multiplicative models is that data with more complicated environmental structure are often forced to fit the two-way framework. As a partial solution to this problem, three-way multiplicative models are presented that can be used in addition to the more familiar two-way multiplicative models. Most importantly, a three-way generalization is given of the two-way singular-value decomposition that can be applied for closer inspection of three-way analysis of variance interaction, much in the same way as its two-way counterpart is used for two-way interaction. Two real data sets are analyzed to illustrate how two- and three-way multiplicative models for interaction jointly provide parsimonious descriptions of various types of genotype-by-environment interaction. These parsimonious descriptions are often open to meaningful biological interpretations as well.},

Data-driven approaches build on larger volumes of data and flexible analyses that link different datasets across domains and disciplines. This can lead to more information-rich management of crop diversity, which can address the complex interactions between crop diversity, production environments, and socioeconomic heterogeneity and help to deliver more suitable portfolios of crop diversity to users with highly diverse demands. We describe recent efforts that illustrate the potential of data-driven approaches for crop diversity management. A continued investment in this area should fill remaining gaps and seize opportunities, including i) supporting genebanks to play a more active role in linking with farmers using data-driven approaches; ii) designing low-cost, appropriate technologies for phenotyping; iii) generating more and better gender and socioeconomic data; iv) designing information products to facilitate decision-making; and v) building more capacity in data science. Broad, well-coordinated policies and investments are needed to avoid fragmentation of such capacities and achieve coherence between domains and disciplines so that crop diversity management systems can become more effective in delivering benefits to farmers, consumers, and other users of crop diversity.},

  abstract = {Two-stage analysis methods are often used in multi-environment trials (MET) for plant variety selection, when a single-stage approach is not feasible or too time consuming. In any two-stage analysis, the estimated effects taken to stage two must be unbiased for the effects of interest, and this means using best linear unbiased estimates based on a model with fixed genetic effects. The error (or weights) associated with the estimates must also be taken to stage two. These weights are functions of unknown variance parameters that need to be estimated at stage one. These parameters may be better estimated if genetic effects are taken as random, but resulting predicted genetic effects are biased. The bias can be removed by so-called de-regression in animal sciences. The proper weights involve a block diagonal matrix with blocks corresponding to environments, whereas diagonal weights were originally proposed in animal sciences. Two MET experiments, one fully replicated and one with partial replication of varieties, were used to compare one-stage and two-stage approaches. The results were similar, but using a full weight matrix for two-stage methods was superior to using diagonal weights. A small simulation study for trials with partial replication showed that fitting random genetic effects, de-regressing, and using a full weight matrix, was very similar to a one-stage analysis, and was superior to starting with fixed genetic effects at stage one. The use of diagonal weights was found to be very poor.},

PEGS-based unstructured model was orders of magnitude faster than restricted maximum likelihood (REML) based multivariate genomic best linear unbiased predictions (GBLUP) while providing the same accuracy. MegaSEM provided the lowest runtime, fitting a model with 200 traits and 20,000 individuals in {$\sim$}5 min, and a model with 2,000 traits and 2,000 individuals in less than 3 min. With the genomes-to-fields data, the most accurate predictions were attained with the univariate model fitted across environments and by averaging environment-level genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs) from models with HCS and XFA covariance structures.},

The second section is a detailed treatment of biplot analysis of genotype by environment data. It addresses environment and genotype evaluation from all perspectives. The third section deals with biplot analysis of various two-way tables that can be generated from a three-way MET dataset, which is an integral and essential part to a fuller understanding and exploration of MET data. The final section discusses questions that are frequently asked about biplot analysis.

An implicated but rarely tested hypothesis is that multiple-year data are more predictive than single-year data of cultivar performance in the next year. Yield data of the 1991 to 2000 Ontario Soybean Variety Trials in the 2800 Crop Heat Unit (CHU) area were used to study the power of single-year, multiple-location trials in predicting cultivar performances in the following year, and to see if data from multiple-year trials are more predictive. Mixed models were used to estimate best linear unbiased predictions (BLUP) of tested genotypes on the basis of single- or multiple-year trials, and the t-statistic of BLUP (tBLUP) was used as a measure of cultivar performance. Results indicated that a single-year, multiple-location trial had sufficient power for identifying genotypes that would perform well or poorly in the next year. Two to four years' data gave only slightly better predictions of next-year performances than single-year data but allowed more genotypes to be evaluated conclusively. The tBLUP of genotype effects based on 2 yr of multiple-location trials should be used as a basis for soybean cultivar selection and recommendation in the 2800 CHU area of Ontario.},

However, we show that when training a policy based on the learned reward model, MLE fails while a pessimistic MLE provides policies with improved performance under certain coverage assumptions. Additionally, we demonstrate that under the PL model, the true MLE and an alternative MLE that splits the \$K\$-wise comparison into pairwise comparisons both converge. Moreover, the true MLE is asymptotically more efficient. Our results validate the empirical success of existing RLHF algorithms in InstructGPT and provide new insights for algorithm design.

We examine an alternative approach in which the spatial heterogeneity is modeled directly. The model underlying our approach is similar to the model underlying a geostatistical kriging analysis and, as in the latter model, the observations are regarded collectively as a partial realization of a random field. A randomization study of uniformity trial data suggests that the random field approach often provides more accurate estimates of treatment contrasts than nearest-neighbor approaches. In addition, the random field approach is devoid of ambiguities as to the handling of border plots and is generally more flexible than nearest-neighbor approaches.},

  abstract = {Yield trials frequently have both significant main effects and a significant genotype X environment (GE) interaction. Traditional statistical analyses are not always effective with this data structure: the usual analysis of variance (ANOVA), having a merely additive model, identifies the GE interaction as a source but does not analyze it; principal components analysis (PCA), on the other hand is a multiplicative model and hence contains no sources for additive genotype or environment main effects; and linear regression (LR) analysis is able to effectively analyze interaction terms only where the pattern fits a specific regression model. The consequence of fitting inappropriate statistical models to yield trial data is that the interaction may be declared nonsignificant, although a more appropriate analysis would find agronomically important and statistically significant patterns in the interaction. Therefore, agronomists and plant breeders may fail to perceive important interaction effects. This paper compares the above three traditional models with the additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) Model, in an analysis of a soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] yield trial. ANOVA fails to detect a significant interaction component, PCA fails to identify and separate the significant genotype and environment main effects, and LR accounts for only a small portion of the interaction sum of squares. On the other hand, AMMI analysis reveals a highly significant interaction component that has clear agronomic meaning. Since ANOVA, PCA, and LR are sub-cases of the more complete AMMI model, AMMI offers a more appropriate first statistical analysis of yield trials that may have a genotype X environment interaction. AMMI analysis can then be used to diagnose whether or not a specific sub-case provides a more appropriate analysis. AMMI has no specific experimental design requirements, except for a two-way data structure.},
